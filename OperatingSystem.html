        <b title="What is Operating System" style="color:crimson">What is O.S.?</b> :- An <b title="operating system">O.S.</b> is a program that manages application programs and acts as an intermediary <b title="between">b/w</b> the computer user and the computer hardware.The purpose of operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute program in a convenient and efficient manner.<br/>Operating system is a system software with provide an environment to help the user to execute the programs. The operating system is a resource manager which allocates and manages various resourses like processes, main memory, <b title="i/o">input/output</b> device and information on secondary storage devices.

            <li><b style="color:crimson">Process Managment :-</b> It means assining processor to different task which has to be performed by the computer system.</li>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Memory Managment :-</b> It means a location of main memory and secondary storage area to the system programs as well as user programs and data.</li>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Input and Output Managment :-</b> It means coordination assignment of different output and input devices while one or more programs are executed.</li>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">File system Managment :-</b> Operating system also responsible for maintanance of a file system, in which the users are allowed to created, delete and move files.</li>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Establishment and Enforcement of a priority system:-</b> It means the operating system determines and maintains the order in which jobs are to be executed in the computer system.</li>

        <h2><u style="color:chartreuse">Evolution of operating system (Types of Operating System) :-</u></h2>
        <h3 style="color:chocolate"> A brief description of the Evolution of operating system has been described below.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Simple batch operating system :-</b> In the earliest bay digit computer usually runs from a cansole. Input/Output devices cansisteb of card reader, tape drives and lind printers. Direct user intervention with the system did not exist. User made a job wiht cansisting of programs. Data and control information. The job was submitted to an operator who would execute the job on the computer system. The output appeared after minutes hours or sometimes days. The user collected the output from the operator. Which also include a memory dump. The operating system was very simple and its major task was to be transfer control from one job to another. The operating system was resident in memory. To speed up processing, jobs with the same needs were bached together are executed as a group. For example, all FORTRAN as a group. Together for execution, thus batch operating system come into existence. Even though processing speed increased to large extent becouse of batch processing. The <b title="Central processing Unit">CPU</b> was often idle. This is becouse of the disparity between operating speed of electronic device like the CPU and the machanical input output devices. CPU operates in the micro-second or nano-second range where as input output devices work in the second or minutes range. To overcome this problem the concept of spooling came into picture. Instead of reading from slow input devices like card reader into the computer memory and then processing the job, the input is first read into the disk. When the job is processed or executed. The input is read directly from the disk. Similarly when a job is executed for printing, the output is written into a buffer on the disk and actually printed later. This form of prossing is known as spooling. Spooling uses the disc as a large buffer to read ahead as possible on input devices and for storing output untill output devices are available to accepts them. Spooling increases the performance of the system by alloeing both a faster CPU and slower input output devices to work at higher operating rate.</li>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Multi-Programmed batch operating system :-</b> Job scheduling bring in the ability of multiprogramming. A single user cannot keep both CPU and input device busy. Multiprogramming increases CPU untilisation by organising jobs. Choosing one out of several ready jobs in memory for execution by the CPU is called the CPU scheduling.
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Time sharing operating system :-</b> CPU scheduling and multiprogramming provide each user one time slice in a time shared system.</li>
        </ul>
