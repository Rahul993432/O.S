        <b title="What is Operating System" style="color:crimson">What is O.S.?</b> :- An <b title="operating system">O.S.</b> is a program that manages application programs and acts as an intermediary <b title="between">b/w</b> the computer user and the computer hardware.The purpose of operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute program in a convenient and efficient manner.<br/>Operating system is a system software with provide an environment to help the user to execute the programs. The operating system is a resource manager which allocates and manages various resourses like processes, main memory, <b title="i/o">input/output</b> device and information on secondary storage devices.

        <h2><u style="color:chartreuse;background-color: black;">Evolution of operating system (Types of Operating System) :-</u></h2>
        <h3 style="color:chocolate"> A brief description of the Evolution of operating system has been described below.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Simple batch operating system :-</b> In the earliest bay digit computer usually runs from a cansole. Input/Output devices cansisteb of card reader, tape drives and lind printers. Direct user intervention with the system did not exist. User made a job wiht cansisting of programs. Data and control information. The job was submitted to an operator who would execute the job on the computer system. The output appeared after minutes hours or sometimes days. The user collected the output from the operator. Which also include a memory dump. The operating system was very simple and its major task was to be transfer control from one job to another. The operating system was resident in memory. To speed up processing, jobs with the same needs were bached together are executed as a group. For example, all FORTRAN as a group. Together for execution, thus batch operating system come into existence. Even though processing speed increased to large extent becouse of batch processing. The <b title="Central processing Unit">CPU</b> was often idle. This is becouse of the disparity between operating speed of electronic device like the CPU and the machanical input output devices. CPU operates in the micro-second or nano-second range where as input output devices work in the second or minutes range. To overcome this problem the concept of spooling came into picture. Instead of reading from slow input devices like card reader into the computer memory and then processing the job, the input is first read into the disk. When the job is processed or executed. The input is read directly from the disk. Similarly when a job is executed for printing, the output is written into a buffer on the disk and actually printed later. This form of prossing is known as spooling. Spooling uses the disc as a large buffer to read ahead as possible on input devices and for storing output untill output devices are available to accepts them. Spooling increases the performance of the system by alloeing both a faster CPU and slower input output devices to work at higher operating rate.</li>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Multi-Programmed batch operating system :-</b> Job scheduling bring in the ability of multiprogramming. A single user cannot keep both CPU and input device busy. Multiprogramming increases CPU untilisation by organising jobs. Choosing one out of several ready jobs in memory for execution by the CPU is called the CPU scheduling.
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Time sharing operating system :-</b> CPU scheduling and multiprogramming provide each user one time slice in a time shared system. A program in execution is reterred to as a process. A process execute for one time slice at a time. A process may need more than one time slice to complete. During a time slice a process may finish execution or go for an input output. The CPU switches between processes at the end of a time slice. The switching between processes is so fast that the user gets the illusion that the CPU is rxecuting only one user's process.<br/>Time sharing operating system are more complex than multiprogrammed operating system becouse in multiprogramming several jobs are must be kept simultaneously in memory. Which requires some form of memory managment and protection. Jobs we have to be swapped in and out of main memory to the secondary memory. To achive this goal a techanique called virtural memory is used.<br/>Multiprogramming and time sharing are the main concepts is all modern operating system.</li>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Personal computer operating system :-</b> The main mode of a user <b title="Personal Computer">PC</b> is by a single user. The operating system for <b title="Personal Computers">PCs</b> were designed as a single task operating system.<br/>The operating system of PCs consists of two parts. One part is called the basic <b title="Basic input/output system">BIOS</b> which is stored in <b title="Read only memory">ROM</b>. The other part is stored in  floppy disk or hard disk. When power is turned on <b title="Basic Output/Input System">BIOS</b> takes control. It does what is known as <b title="power on self test">POST</b>. The test sees whether memory is ok and all other relevant units function. Having done this, it reads from the disk a small portion of <b title="Operating System">O.S</b> known as the boot and load it into the memory. This boot program then "pulls" the rest of the operating system from the disk and store it in the main memory. This is known as "booting the system".</li>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Multiprocessor operating system (Parallel system) :-</b> Multiprocessing system will be having more than one processor and all these processor will share the computer bus, the clock and sometimes memory and peripheral devices. These system becouse the processes share the memory or a clock.<br/>There are several resons for building such systems. One advantage is increased throughput. By increasing the number of processors we can get more work done in a shorter time. Another advantages is, it can save money compared to multiple single systems becouse the processes can share peripherals, cabinates and power supplies. Another advantage is that they increase reliability. If functions can be distributed properly among the several processor than the failure of one processor will not halt the system but rather will only slow it down.</li>
            <b><u style="color:powderblue;background-color:black">There are two most common type of Multiprocessor system :-</u></b>
            <ol>
                <li> Symmetric multiprocessor model, in which each processor runs and identical copy of the operating system and these copies communicates with one another as needed.</li>
                <li> Asymmetric multiprocessor model, in which is processor is assigned a specific task. Here one processor serves  as master which control the entire system and all the other processes serve as slaves. This model represent a master-slave relationship.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Distributed system :-</b> In this type of system all the computations are distributed among several processes. distributed system also referred as loosely coupled systems becouse the processor do not share the memory or a clock. Each processor has its own local memory. The processor communicate with one another through various communication lines, such as high speed buses or telephone lines. The processors in distributed system vary in size, function and referred as sites, nodes, computers and so on, depending on the context in which they are mentioned.</li>
            <b><u style="color:powderblue;background-color:black">Reasons for building distributed system :-</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li><b style="color:green">Resource sharing :-</b> If different user are connected to one another with different resources then the user at one site may be able to use the resources available at another.</li>
                <li><b style="color:green">Computation speedup :-</b> In distributed system a particular Computation will be partitioned into number of sub computations that can run concrrently. in addition to this, distributed system may allow us to distributed the computations among various sites. it is called load sharing.</li>
                <li><b style="color:green">Reliability :-</b> it means, if one system fails, the remaining site will share the work of failed site.</li>
                <li><b style="color:green">Communication :-</b> When many side are connected to one another by communication network. The process at different sites have the opportunity to exchange information. A user may initiate file transfer ar communicate with one another via email.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b style="color:crimson">Real time system :-</b> Real time operating system are specialy disigned to respond to event that happens in real time. it has well defined, fixed time constants. Processing must be done within the define constants or else the system will fail. This feature is very useful in implementing systems such as airlines reservation system. There are two types of real time system. A hard time system guaranteen that critial task complete at a specified time. A less restrictive type of real time system, where is critial real time task gets priority over other task and remains that priority until. It completes. The several areas in which this type is useful are multimedia, advanced scientific project. Becouse of the expanded used for soft real time functionality. It is finding its way into most current operating systems including major version of unix and windows NT operating system.</li>
